## About Us

This site was created by Toby Hausler, Matthew Santoyo, Zach Wergeland, and Payton Bell during University of Oregon's DSCI350 class Winter term. Matthew and Toby, our Collection Managers, focused on finding and taking care of data within the collection; Payton, our Github manager focused on managing and maintaining the Github Repository for this project, and Zach, our Project Manager, focused on managing the project and submitting appropriate forms and progress to Canvas. Github Repository can be found here: https://github.com/psbuo/worlds-fair

## About Our Project

The theme of this collection is comparing the progress, vision
of the future, and state of the world as seen through the Chicago world fairs of 1893 and 1933. With this collection we will showcase the dramatic social change between these time periods and shed light on the way the world has changed and will continue to change since then. This collection is a resource for seeing the evolution of the scientific discoveries and biases of the world and understanding how far humanity evolves in as short a time as 40 years.

This collection contains findings of artifacts and exhibits presented at the world fair, as well as journalistic articles illustrating the advertising and cultural impact of these fairs. These contents come from digital libraries and newspaper archives meant to exhibit the history of both the world and, in particular, Chicago. This collection should act as its own world fair, to showcase the might of modern day technology we take for granted.

## Course Description

In this class, we’ll learn about the theory and practice of how people who work in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums manage data. We’ll look at & work with the different forms this data can take, such as images, video, sound, text, and maps, and examine the processes by which they are made available to interested humanities scholars. 

## About the Course

Human Research Data Management (DSCI 350M/350M) is a course offered at the University of Oregon through the Digital Humanities minor. Lead by Franny Gaede (she/her) with course support from Associate Librarian Rayne Vieger, and Assistant Librarian Erin Winter.

## About CollectionBuilder-Sheets

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-Sheets](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-sheets), a template  for creating simple digital exhibit websites by loading collection metadata directly from a CSV, designed for teaching digital library skills and easy hosting on GitHub Pages.

Using CB-Sheets, it is possible to use a live Google Sheets spreadsheet for your collection metadata, allowing you to see the outcome of metadata edits update immediately.
This enables active collaboration to prototype collections with minimal set up.

## Create your own Metadata

To create metadata compatible with this CollectionBuilder-Sheets instance the best way to get started is to make of copy of our template in Google Drive:

[CollectionBuilder Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/copy?usp=sharing){:.btn .btn-outline-primary target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
{:.text-center}

Alternatively, you can [download the template CSV]({{ '/assets/metadata-template.csv' | relative_url }}) and work on your local machine.
We suggest editing your CSV using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Calc, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), or Google Sheets (and do not suggest using Excel, since Excel's CSV output is not correctly formatted).

Describe your items in your copy of the template, following the [Metadata Guidelines]({{ '/metadata.html' | relative_url }}). 

Once you have items added you can test your metadata by clicking the "Change the Metadata" button above.
